    <p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace 'accidentally' with 'repeatedly' and replace 'dog' with 'son.' Ahoy hoy?</p> <p>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. I didn't get rich by signing checks. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.</p> <ul> <li>But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.</li> <li>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li> <li>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</li> <li>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</li> </ul> <p>Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as 'Smoke Yourself Thin' and 'Get Some Confidence, Stupid!' Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p> <p>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p> <ol> <li>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</li> <li>Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing?</li> <li>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</li> </ol> <p>Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
